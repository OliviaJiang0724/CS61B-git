#### This is the course project GitLet for CS61B in Spring 2022, which intended to replicate a mini-version of Git.

#### Belows are the description from project website:

- The main functionality that Gitlet supports is:

- Saving the contents of entire directories of files. In Gitlet, this is called committing, and the saved contents themselves are called commits.
- Restoring a version of one or more files or entire commits. In Gitlet, this is called checking out those files or that commit.
- Viewing the history of your backups. In Gitlet, you view this history in something called the log.
- Maintaining related sequences of commits, called branches.
- Merging changes made in one branch into another.
